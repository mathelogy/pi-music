"Listen to the sound of π - the king of numbers"

👑 Created by Mathelogy
Mathematics meets music in this unique auditory experience

🎹 What is Pi Music?
Pi Music is an interactive web application that converts the infinite digits of π (pi) into musical notes in real-time. Each digit (0-9) is mapped to a specific musical note, creating an endless, unique composition based on the mathematical constant.
